# Shonen Jump Publishing

## Project Overview

In this capstone project, I created an internal tool for a comic book publishing company called XPress Publishing.

The XPress Publishing internal tool should allow users to:

- Create, view, and update artists
- Create, view, update, and delete comic book series
- Create, view, update, and delete issues of a specific comic book series

You can view all of this functionality in action in the video below:

## How To Begin

- Download the code for this project. After downloading the zip folder, double click it to uncompress it and access the contents of this project.

- Install all the modules needed by this project by running `npm install` in the project root

- Open the `index.html`

- Run the server by `node server.js` in the project root

## Testing

A testing suite has been provided, checking for all essential functionality and edge cases.

To run these tests, first, open the root project directory in your terminal. Then run `npm install` to install all necessary testing dependencies (if you haven't already). Finally, run `npm test`. You will see a list of tests that ran with information about whether or not each test passed. After this list, you will see more specific output about why each failing test failed.
